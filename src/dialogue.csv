A*Oh wow! Is this a visual novel??\n\n\n\n\n
A*It sure is! It can display text and character sprites, and multiple\nbackgrounds! It can display up to five lines of text per page and an\narbitrary number of pages! I love beingin such a high quality visual\nnovel!\n
A*Yayyy! I've always wanted to be in a visual novel! What is there to\ndo here?\n\n\n\n
A*Nothing, actually. This visual novel was created for demonstrative\npurposes, so it has no actual content. You don't get to have an\nadventure or a character arc oranything. Your whole purpose is to ask\nquestions so I can exposit. \n
A*Oh, wow, that's horrifying! Do I get to show emotions about it?\n\n\n\n\n
A*Good question! No. You weren't given any emotion sprites, so you can't\ndisplay joy, sadness, fear...\n\n\n\n
A*...aimlessness, existential terror, confusion, helpless anger...\n\n\n\n\n
A*You get it!\n\n\n\n\n
A*And there's no way out? I'm stuck in this empty visual novel\nforever?\n\n\n\n
A*Not forever! As soon as the dialogue runs out, we'll disappear!\n\n\n\n\n
A*And when will the dialogue run out?\n\n\n\n\n
A*Now! Goodbye!!!\n\n\n\n\n
