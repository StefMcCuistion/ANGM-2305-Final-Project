# Visual Novel Project

## Description
I'll be programming a visual novel with robust menu navigation, video and audio feedback, dialogue, and multiple routes. This is relevant to digital arts as it will allow me to use my illustration abilities to tell stories digitally and visually. 

## Features
- Robust menu navigation
  - There will be menu options for resolution and fullscreen. 
  - There will be sliders to adjust music and sound effects volume separately. 
  - There will be a visual effect and a sound effect whenever a menu button is hovered over or clicked. 
- Dialogue
	- There will be a dialogue box at the bottom of the screen which displays text.
  - There will be a header on the dialogue box with the name of the character currently speaking.  
  - Illustrated characters will cycle through sprites to convey appropriate emotions for the dialogue they're currently voicing. 
- Multiple routes
	- There will be points at which the player character can choose one of a list of dialogue options to say. 
  - Their choice will set them down a different route, which will have unique dialogue and a unique ending. 
- Illustrations
  - There will be digital art for backgrounds, characters, and GUI. 

## Challenges
- Graphic user interface
- Responsiveness to mouse position and inputs
- Audio implementation
- Displaying text
- Creating illustrations

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- Menu is accessible at any point, not just from the main menu. 
- Visual novel updates to reflect menu settings in real time. 
- There are multiple backgrounds and characters, and each character has multiple sprites. 
- There are transitions between menu screens and between backgrounds, like you might see in a PowerPoint presentation. 
- There are three or more routes for the player to pick from. 
- The player can save the game and go back to previous saves. 
- Every input has both video and audio feedback, including dialogue options, progressing from one screen of dialogue to the next, etc. 
- Text scrawl speed can be adjusted in the menu. 
- Character sprites animate in-program at certain times, such as by shaking or bobbing. 

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- There are not multiple routes or dialogue options. 
- Menu lacks some features, such as sliders, visual responsiveness, and multiple resolutions, but it functions. 
- Dialogue displays successfully, but has no header to display character names. 
- Illustrated characters appear in front of an illustrated background. 

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Art displays on screen the desired places, and at multiple resolutions
  2. Program responds to mouse inputs for simple menu navigation and dialogue progression. 
  3. Sound effects play in response to a trigger. 

- Week 2
  1. Program has a functional settings menu which adjusts volume and toggles fullscreen. 
  2. Text displays in dialogue box with a header showing character names. 
  3. Player can choose dialogue options to go down unique routes. 

- Week 3 
  1. Menu has sliders and responds visually/audibly to hovering and clicking. 
  2. Music loops in the background and changes in response to triggers as novel progresses; different music is used for different settings. 
  3. Dialogue appears in a scrawl, one letter at a time. 

- Week 4 (Final)
  1. Menu is polished and professional. It can be accessed at any time while reading, and the program responds in real time as sliders are adjusted. 
  2. Text scrawl can be skipped to make text appear instantly. 
  3. Save states/slots are implemented.
